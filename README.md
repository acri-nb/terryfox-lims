   # Create and activate a Conda environment
   conda create -n terryfox python=3.9
   conda activate terryfox
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run migrations to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. Create a superuser account:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application
   - For admin access, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
   - Use the admin panel to create required user groups:
     - Create "PI" group (Read-only access)
     - Create "Bioinformatician" group (CRUD access)
     - Assign users to these groups

## User Roles

- **Superuser/Admin**: Full access to all features and admin panel
- **PI (Principal Investigator)**: Read-only access to view projects and cases
- **Bioinformatician**: Full CRUD permissions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on projects and cases

## Usage

1. Login with your user credentials
2. From the dashboard, you can see all projects
3. Click on a project to view its cases
4. Click on a case to view its details, including status, coverage information, and accession numbers
5. Bioinformaticians can create, edit, and delete projects and cases
6. PIs can view all information but cannot make changes

## Development

This project follows standard Django application architecture:

- `core/models.py`: Database models
- `core/views.py`: View functions
- `core/forms.py`: Forms for data input
- `core/admin.py`: Admin interface configuration
- `templates/`: HTML templates
