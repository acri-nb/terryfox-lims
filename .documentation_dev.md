## Project Overview

TerryFox LIMS is a custom Laboratory Information Management System designed to track research projects and their associated cases. The application allows management of:

- Projects with their metadata
- Project leads who manage projects
- Cases associated with these projects
- Sequencing and analysis status of cases
- Coverage values (RNA, DNA-T, DNA-N)
- Tier classifications (A, B, FA)
- Accession numbers
- Comments

The system implements role-based access control with three user levels:
- Administrators (superuser): full access
- PI (Principal Investigator): read-only access
- Bioinformaticians: CRUD rights on projects, project leads, and cases

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django 5.0+, Python 3.8+
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
- **Main Dependencies**:
  - crispy-forms: For improved form rendering
  - crispy-bootstrap5: Bootstrap 5 integration with crispy-forms

## Data Models

The system is based on five main models that represent the essential entities of the LIMS.

### ProjectLead Model

```python
class ProjectLead(models.Model):
    """Model representing a project lead in the LIMS."""
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
        
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['name']
        verbose_name = _('Project Lead')
        verbose_name_plural = _('Project Leads')
```

The `ProjectLead` model represents individuals who lead research projects. Project leads can be associated with multiple projects.

### Project Model

```python
class Project(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    project_lead = models.ForeignKey(
        ProjectLead, 
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL, 
        null=True, 
        blank=True,
        related_name='projects',
        verbose_name=_('Project Lead')
    )
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='created_projects')
```

The `Project` model represents a research project. Each project can be associated with a project lead and can contain multiple cases.

### Case Model

```python
class Case(models.Model):
    STATUS_CHOICES = [
        ('received', _('Received')),
        ('library_prepped', _('Library Prepped')),
        ('transferred_to_nfl', _('Transferred to NFL')),
        ('bioinfo_analysis', _('Bioinfo Analysis')),
        ('completed', _('Completed')),
    ]
    
    TIER_CHOICES = [
        ('A', _('A')),
        ('B', _('B')),
        ('FA', _('FAIL')),
    ]
    
    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='cases')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='received')
    rna_coverage = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('RNA Coverage (M)'))
    dna_t_coverage = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('DNA (T) Coverage (X)'))
    dna_n_coverage = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True, verbose_name=_('DNA (N) Coverage (X)'))
    tier = models.CharField(max_length=4, choices=TIER_CHOICES, default='A')
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
```

The `Case` model represents an individual case within a project. It contains information about status, coverage values, and tier classification.

### Accession Model

```python
class Accession(models.Model):
    case = models.ForeignKey(Case, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='accessions')
    accession_number = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

The `Accession` model stores accession numbers associated with a case.

### Comment Model

```python
class Comment(models.Model):
    case = models.ForeignKey(Case, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    text = models.TextField()
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

The `Comment` model allows users to add comments to a particular case.

### Relationships Between Models

- A `ProjectLead` can lead multiple `Project` entities (one-to-many relationship)
- A `Project` can contain multiple `Case` entities (one-to-many relationship)
- A `Case` can have multiple `Accession` entities (one-to-many relationship)
- A `Case` can have multiple `Comment` entities (one-to-many relationship)
- Each `Comment` is associated with a `User` (many-to-one relationship)
- Each `Project` is associated with a `User` via `created_by` (many-to-one relationship)

## Views and Controllers

The system uses function-based views to implement controller logic.

### Main Views

- **home**: Home page displaying all projects and system-wide statistics (total projects, projects by lead, total cases, cases by status, cases by tier)
- **project_detail**: Displays project details, its associated cases, and project-specific statistics (total cases, cases by status, cases by tier)
- **case_detail**: Displays case details with forms for editing (if the user has permissions)
- **project_create**, **project_update**, **project_delete**: CRUD management for projects
- **case_create**, **case_delete**: CRUD management for cases
- **project_lead_list**, **project_lead_create**, **project_lead_update**, **project_lead_delete**: CRUD management for project leads
- **batch_case_create**: Allows batch creation of multiple cases at once
- **csv_case_import**: Allows importing cases from a CSV file

### Filter Forms

Forms for search and filtering are defined in `forms.py`:

- **ProjectFilterForm**: Form for filtering projects on the home page by name and project lead
- **CaseFilterForm**: Form for filtering cases on the project detail page by name, status, and tier

### Forms

Forms are defined in `forms.py` and use Django's form system:

- **ProjectLeadForm**: Creation and modification of project leads
- **ProjectForm**: Creation and modification of projects, including selecting a project lead
- **CaseForm**: Creation and modification of cases
- **BatchCaseForm**: Form for batch creation of cases
- **CSVImportForm**: Form for uploading CSV files with case data
- **CommentForm**: Adding comments
- **AccessionForm**: Managing accession numbers
- **AccessionFormSet**: Formset for managing multiple accession numbers

### Template Tags and Filters

Custom template tags and filters are defined in `core/templatetags/core_extras.py`:

- **get_item**: Filter to get a value from a dictionary by key
- **to_json**: Filter to convert a Python object to JSON for use in JavaScript

### Typical Workflows

#### Project Lead Management
1. The user (Bioinformatician or Admin) accesses the project leads list view
2. They can view all project leads and the number of projects associated with each
3. They can create, edit, or delete project leads (if not associated with any projects)

#### Project Creation
1. The user (Bioinformatician or Admin) accesses the project creation view
2. The form is displayed via `ProjectForm` with a dropdown of project leads
3. The user fills in the information, selects a project lead, and submits the form
4. The `project_create` view processes the form, creates the project, and redirects to the detail page

#### Case Update
1. The user accesses the case detail page
2. If the user has edit permissions, forms are displayed
3. The user updates the information and submits the form
4. The `case_detail` view processes the form and applies the changes

#### CSV Case Import
1. The user (Bioinformatician or Admin) accesses the CSV import view via the "Add Cases with CSV" button on the project detail page
2. The form is displayed via `CSVImportForm` for uploading a CSV file
3. The user uploads a CSV file with case data following the required format
4. The `csv_case_import` view validates the CSV, creates new cases or updates existing ones, and redirects to the project detail page with a success message

## Templates and UI

The system uses Bootstrap 5 for the user interface, combined with custom styles.

### Template Structure

- **base.html**: Base template containing the HTML structure common to all pages
- **Specific templates**: Inherit from base.html and implement content specific to each view

### UI Components

- **Cards** for displaying projects and cases
- **Badges** for displaying statuses and tier classifications
- **Forms** for data entry and modification
- **Search forms** for filtering projects and cases
- **Breadcrumbs** for hierarchical navigation
- **Alerts** for notification messages
- **Statistics panels** for displaying project and case metrics
- **Tables** for displaying lists (e.g., project leads)

### Custom Styles

Custom styles are defined directly in the `base.html` template via a `<style>` tag. In production, it would be recommended to move them to an external CSS file.

The main customizations include:

- Custom color palette via CSS variables
- Styles for status and tier badges
- Card animations on hover
- Formatting for comment and accession sections
- Styling for statistics panels and badges

### Security Considerations

When implementing links for authentication actions like logout, always use POST requests rather than GET requests to prevent CSRF attacks. For example, implement logout buttons like this:

```html
<!-- CORRECT: Logout with POST request -->
<form method="post" action="{% url 'logout' %}" style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button type="submit" class="dropdown-item">
        <i class="fas fa-sign-out-alt me-1"></i> Logout
    </button>
</form>

<!-- INCORRECT: Logout with GET request -->
<a class="dropdown-item" href="{% url 'logout' %}">
    <i class="fas fa-sign-out-alt me-1"></i> Logout
</a>
```

This is important because:
1. Django's authentication system expects POST requests for logout operations
2. GET requests for authentication actions can be vulnerable to CSRF attacks
3. Using forms with CSRF tokens ensures proper security

## Permission System

The system uses Django's built-in groups and permissions to manage access to features.

### User Groups

- **PI (Principal Investigator)**: Read-only access to all information
- **Bioinformatician**: Full access to create, read, update, and delete projects, project leads, and cases

### Permission Implementation

Permissions are checked in two ways:

1. **Decorators**: Sensitive views use `@permission_required` to check permissions before executing logic
2. **Contextual verification**: Templates adapt the UI based on user permissions via `can_edit`

### Group Initialization

Groups are automatically created during migration via a `post_migrate` signal:

```python
@receiver(post_migrate)
def init_groups(sender, **kwargs):
    if sender.name == 'core':
        Group.objects.get_or_create(name='PI')
        Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Bioinformatician')
```

## Search and Filtering

The system implements robust search and filtering capabilities to help users quickly find the information they need.

### Project Filtering (Home Page)

Users can filter projects on the home page using the following criteria:
- **Project Name**: Text search that filters projects by name (case-insensitive)
- **Project Lead**: Dropdown selection that filters projects by the selected project lead

The filter form is implemented as `ProjectFilterForm` in `forms.py` and processed in the `home` view:

```python
class ProjectFilterForm(forms.Form):
    """Form for filtering projects on the home page."""
    name = forms.CharField(
        required=False, 
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={
            'class': 'form-control',
            'placeholder': _('Search by project name...')
        })
    )
    project_lead = forms.ModelChoiceField(
        queryset=ProjectLead.objects.all(),
        required=False,
        empty_label=_("All Project Leads"),
        widget=forms.Select(attrs={'class': 'form-select'})
    )
```

The filter implementation in the `home` view applies filters conditionally based on the form data:

```python
# Apply filters if the form is valid
if filter_form.is_valid():
    project_name = filter_form.cleaned_data.get('name')
    project_lead = filter_form.cleaned_data.get('project_lead')
    
    if project_name:
        projects = projects.filter(name__icontains=project_name)
        
    if project_lead:
        projects = projects.filter(project_lead=project_lead)
```

### Case Filtering (Project Detail Page)

Users can filter cases on the project detail page using the following criteria:
- **Case Name**: Text search that filters cases by name (case-insensitive)
- **Status**: Dropdown selection that filters cases by status (Received, Library Prepped, Transferred to NFL, etc.)
- **Tier**: Dropdown selection that filters cases by tier classification (A, B, FA)

The filter form is implemented as `CaseFilterForm` in `forms.py` and processed in the `project_detail` view:

```python
class CaseFilterForm(forms.Form):
    """Form for filtering cases on the project detail page."""
    name = forms.CharField(
        required=False, 
        widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={
            'class': 'form-control',
            'placeholder': _('Search by name...')
        })
    )
    status = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[('', _('All Statuses'))] + Case.STATUS_CHOICES,
        required=False,
        widget=forms.Select(attrs={'class': 'form-select'})
    )
    tier = forms.ChoiceField(
        choices=[('', _('All Tiers'))] + Case.TIER_CHOICES,
        required=False,
        widget=forms.Select(attrs={'class': 'form-select'})
    )
```

The filter implementation in the `project_detail` view:

```python
# Apply filters if the form is valid
if filter_form.is_valid():
    case_name = filter_form.cleaned_data.get('name')
    case_status = filter_form.cleaned_data.get('status')
    case_tier = filter_form.cleaned_data.get('tier')
    
    if case_name:
        cases = cases.filter(name__icontains=case_name)
    
    if case_status:
        cases = cases.filter(status=case_status)
        
    if case_tier:
        cases = cases.filter(tier=case_tier)
```

### Batch Case Creation

The system provides a feature to create multiple cases at once in a batch, available only to users with CRUD permissions (Bioinformaticians and Administrators):

1. Access the batch creation by clicking the "Add Cases in Batch" button on the project detail page
2. Specify the following parameters:
   - **Batch Name**: Used as a prefix for the case names
   - **First Case Number**: The starting number in the sequence
   - **Last Case Number**: The ending number in the sequence
   - **Default Values**: Status, RNA coverage, DNA-T coverage, and DNA-N coverage to apply to all cases
3. Cases will be created with names following the pattern `{batch_name}-{number}` for each number in the specified range
   - For example: "Lung-5", "Lung-6", "Lung-7", etc.

The batch creation is implemented as a dedicated form and view:

```python
class BatchCaseForm(forms.Form):
    min_case_number = forms.IntegerField(min_value=1, ...)
    max_case_number = forms.IntegerField(min_value=2, ...)
    batch_name = forms.CharField(...)
    status = forms.ChoiceField(choices=Case.STATUS_CHOICES, ...)
    rna_coverage = forms.FloatField(required=False, ...)
    dna_t_coverage = forms.FloatField(required=False, ...)
    dna_n_coverage = forms.FloatField(required=False, ...)
    
    def clean(self):
        # Validation to ensure max_case_number >= min_case_number and at least 2 cases
```

```python
@login_required
@permission_required('core.add_case', raise_exception=True)
def batch_case_create(request, project_id):
    # Implementation that creates multiple cases in a batch
    # with names following pattern: {batch_name}-{number}
    # for each number from min_case_number to max_case_number (inclusive)
```

This feature significantly improves efficiency when working with large numbers of related cases or when you need to create cases with specific numbering.

### CSV Case Import

The system provides a feature to import multiple cases at once from a CSV file, available only to users with CRUD permissions (Bioinformaticians and Administrators):

1. Access the CSV import by clicking the "Add Cases with CSV" button on the project detail page
2. Upload a CSV file following the required format:
   - Headers: CaseID, Status, DNAT, DNAN, RNA
   - Status values must match the system's choices (Received, Library Prepped, etc.)
   - Coverage values should be numbers or left empty
3. The system will:
   - Validate the CSV format and data
   - Create new cases for entries that don't exist yet
   - Update existing cases with new data
   - Display a summary of created and updated cases

The CSV import functionality is implemented as:

```python
class CSVImportForm(forms.Form):
    csv_file = forms.FileField(...)
```

```python
@login_required
@permission_required('core.add_case', raise_exception=True)
def csv_case_import(request, project_id):
    # Implementation that imports cases from a CSV file
    # Creates new cases or updates existing ones
```

A template CSV file is provided for users to download and use as a reference. This feature significantly improves efficiency when importing cases from external systems or migrating data.

### User Interface Elements

The search and filter forms are placed at the top of their respective sections with clear labels and intuitive controls. Visual indicators show when filters are active:

- A "Filtered" badge appears next to the section heading
- The number of filtered results is displayed
- A "Clear" button appears to allow users to reset all filters

When a user applies filters, the page shows only the matching items while still displaying statistics based on all data to maintain context.

## API and Extensions

The current system does not expose a REST API but could be extended to do so using Django REST Framework.

### Potential Extension Points

1. **REST API** to allow integration with other systems
2. **Plugin system** to add functionality specific to certain types of projects
3. **Export system** to generate reports in different formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)

### How to Extend the System

#### Adding a New Model

1. Define the model in `models.py`
2. Create migrations with `python manage.py makemigrations`
3. Apply migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
4. Update relevant views, forms, and templates

#### Adding a New Feature

1. Determine if the feature is part of the `core` application or requires a new application
2. Create necessary models, views, forms, and templates
3. Add URLs in `urls.py`
4. Update documentation

## Environment Management

The system is designed to work in different environments: development, test, and production.

### Environment Configuration

The `settings.py` file includes environment-specific settings:

```python
if DEBUG:
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
else:
    # Configure email settings for production
    EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
    # Configure other production settings here
```

### Best Practices for Environments

1. **Development**:
   - Use `DEBUG = True`
   - Use SQLite as the database
   - Use console email backend

2. **Test**:
   - Configure an environment close to production
   - Use a test database
   - Test migrations

3. **Production**:
   - Use `DEBUG = False`
   - Use a PostgreSQL database
   - Configure an SMTP server for emails
   - Use a web server like Nginx or Apache with WSGI
   - Enable HTTPS

### Environment Variables

For better security, sensitive parameters should be stored in environment variables rather than in code. Consider using `python-decouple` or `django-environ` to manage these variables.

## Testing and Code Quality

Although the current project does not contain tests, it is strongly recommended to add them.

### Types of Tests to Implement

1. **Unit tests** for models and utility functions
2. **View tests** to verify controller behavior
3. **Integration tests** to verify complete workflows
4. **Template tests** to ensure the UI works correctly

### Example Unit Test for the Project Model

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from core.models import Project, ProjectLead

class ProjectModelTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='password')
        self.project_lead = ProjectLead.objects.create(name='Test Lead')
        self.project = Project.objects.create(
            name='Test Project',
            description='Test Description',
            project_lead=self.project_lead,
            created_by=self.user
        )
    
    def test_project_creation(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.project.name, 'Test Project')
        self.assertEqual(self.project.description, 'Test Description')
        self.assertEqual(self.project.project_lead, self.project_lead)
        self.assertEqual(self.project.created_by, self.user)
    
    def test_get_cases_count(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.project.get_cases_count(), 0)
```

### Recommended Tools for Code Quality

- **pytest** for running tests
- **flake8** for Python code linting
- **black** for code formatting
- **coverage** for measuring test coverage
- **pre-commit** for automating checks before commits

sudo systemctl enable --now terryfox-lims-watchdog.timer
```

#### 2. **Manual Setup** (if needed)
```bash
# Install dependencies
source /home/hadriengt/miniconda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate django
pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install django-extensions werkzeug pyOpenSSL  # For HTTPS support
   ```

2. **Check Production Configuration**:
   ```bash
   python check_production.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - **Network**: https://10.220.115.67
   - **Local**: https://localhost

#### Legacy Deployment (Obsolete)

> ⚠️ The following methods are obsolete and replaced by the robust Gunicorn setup:

- `start_production.sh` (replaced by systemd service)
- `setup_https_ip.sh` (replaced by direct Gunicorn SSL)
- Nginx proxy setup (no longer required)

The application is now available at `https://10.220.115.67:443` with the robust configuration.

### Security Considerations

#### Production Security Features

1. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Native HTTPS on port 443
2. **Certificate Management**: Self-signed certificates in `/root/ssl/`
3. **Process Isolation**: systemd service with resource limits
4. **Access Control**: IP-based access (10.220.115.67, localhost)
5. **Secure Headers**: Configured in Django settings

#### Security Best Practices

1. **SECRET_KEY**: Kept secure, not in source control
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic redirected to HTTPS
3. **Certificate Warnings**: Expected with self-signed certificates
4. **Resource Limits**: 2GB RAM, 90% CPU limits via systemd
5. **Log Security**: Centralized logging with proper permissions

#### Security Improvements Over Legacy Setup

- ✅ **Robust Process Management**: systemd supervision
- ✅ **Automatic Recovery**: Watchdog monitoring
- ✅ **Resource Isolation**: systemd cgroups
- ✅ **Centralized Logging**: Better audit trail
- ✅ **Production WSGI**: Gunicorn vs development server

## Contribution Guide

### Development Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd terryfox
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n terryfox_dev python=3.9
   conda activate terryfox_dev
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code
- Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Add docstrings for all functions and classes
- Write comments to explain complex code
- Use explicit commit messages

### Contribution Process

1. Create a branch for your feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2. Develop and test your code
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Create a pull request with a detailed description of the changes

### Project-Specific Best Practices

- Do not exceed 200-300 lines per file
- Avoid code duplication
- Monitor production logs regularly
- Test watchdog functionality periodically
- Keep SSL certificates updated
- Document any configuration changes
- Maintain strict separation of concerns (models, views, templates)
- Write code that takes into account different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Never add test data or stub code in the production environment

### Documentation

- Update documentation when you add or modify features
- Document APIs and public functions
- Include usage examples when relevant
